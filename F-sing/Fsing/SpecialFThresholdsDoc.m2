         computes the F-pure threshold of a form in two variables
     Usage
     	  binaryFormFPT(G), binaryFormFPT(factors,multiplicities)
     Inputs 
	factors:List
	    which contains the linear factors of a form G in two variables 
	multiplicities:List
	    which contains the multiplicities of those linear factors in G
	G:RingElement
	    a form in two variables
     Outputs
        :QQ
     Description
	Text
	    binaryFormFPT computes the F-pure threshold of a homogeneous polynomial G
	    	in two variables. 
	Example
	    R = ZZ/3[x,y];
	    G = x^5*y^2-x^3*y^4+x*y^6-y^7;
	    binaryFormFPT(G)
	Text    
	    The method used requires factoring G into linear forms in some extension of the base field. If the user knows such a factorization beforehand, the alternate call binaryFormFPT(factors,multiplicities) can be used for improved performance.
	Example
	    R = ZZ/5[x,y];
	    binaryFormFPT( { x, y, x+y, x+2*y, x+3*y }, { 4, 5, 10, 3, 11 } )
	Text    
	    This is based on the work of Daniel Hernandez and Pedro Teixeira.

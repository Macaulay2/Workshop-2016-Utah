Todo List

1) There are several examples that we had to comment out in order for the package to install. These should be tested and either fixed or deleted.


2) In the documentation for 
(basis, List, SpectralSequencePage)
(basis, ZZ, SpectralSequencePage)

there is a commented out note that says the output is a matrix, but should instead be changed to be a page



3) Comment lines we might want to delete:


Line 754 -- is this what we want??  Or do we only want to view the nonzero modules?
I guess this is a comment on the support. Should we change the code?
Later in the code for the support:
-- this can problably be made more efficient.... 
Should we worry about this at all at this point?

Line 2895, 3928 — do we want to include this example? This comment is old, I don’t know why it was written.

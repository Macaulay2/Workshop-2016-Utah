    RationalMaps package

    The package can be installed and checked with M2 1.16.  It has 1200 lines of code and about the same
    number of lines of documentation.

    The documentation is in rough shape, so instead of finishing the review, I broke off early to give
    the authors a chance to fix it, using my remarks as a guide for the part I didn't look at.  I also
    recommend introducing a new type, "RationalMap", and using it to organize the code more cleanly.

We have created a new type, RationalMapping.  We called it this to avoid conflict with the RationalMap type in the Cremona package.
        

    =============================================================================

    comments on the documentation:


    "While the packageParametrization focuses on mostly on curves"

        insert a space after "package"
        remove the first "on"

Fixed.


    "a function invertBirationalMap which has the same functionality as"

    change "which" to "that"

Fixed.

    "Parametrization.m2" -- change to "Parametrization", for that is the name of the package.
    Also set in italic, as you do your own package's name.  Similarly for Cremona.m2.

Done.


    "were implemented somewhat differently"

        remove "somewhat"

Done.

    "probabilisitc"

        fix

Fixed.


    "degreeOfRationalMap with MathMode=>true can give a deterministic answer."

        change "can give" to "gives"
        consider adding text explaining that the answer is not only deterministic, but correct.

Changed, added correct.

    "If true, certain functions assume that the map from X to Y is dominant."

        change to "whether to assume that a raional map is dominant"

Changed.  Made the analogous change to CheckBiraitonal.

    "X \to Y"

        change to \\to, because \t is the escape character combination for TAB

        i4 : "\to"

        o4 =         o

        i5 : "\\to"

        o5 = \to

We have changed these throughout.

    "Inputs:
        M, a matrix, Row matrix whose entries correspond to the coordinates of your map to projective space."
        
            don't capitalize "Row", because it doesn't start a sentence
            fix everywhere else, too

Done.  Headlines are generally not capitalized now.

    "This defines the locus where a given map of projective varieties is not defined."

        Here "This" refers to what was mentioned in the title (headline), but that's a bit clumsy.
        So phrase it this way:

        "The function baseLocusOfMap defines the locus where a given map of projective varieties is not defined."

        Check other nodes for similar uses


    "Consider the following rational map from P2 to P1"

        add a period to the end

Fixed.

    "a curve on P^2"

        many people prefer to say "in" instead of "on"

Changed.

    Key=>{AssumeDominant, [isBirationalMap, AssumeDominant],
        [isBirationalOntoImage, AssumeDominant],
        [isEmbedding, AssumeDominant],
        [jacobianDualMatrix,AssumeDominant],
        [inverseOfMap, AssumeDominant],
        [sourceInversionFactor, AssumeDominant] },

        One disadvantage of putting tags such as [sourceInversionFactor, AssumeDominant] on
        the same node as the tag for AssumeDominant is that then there is no link
        from that node to the node for sourceInversionFactor.  Wouldn't it look better
        the other way?  Compare with

        https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.16/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/___Verbose.html

        There are probably a lot of other instances of this kind of thing.

I have changed this behavior for:
    Verbose
    AssumeDominant
    (I or someone else needs to finish this)


    "HybridStrategy -- A strategy for inverseOfMap, isBirationalMap and isEmbedding."

            It's too verbose to list the functions affected in the headline.  What about this?:
            "an option specifying an intermediate strategy"


    "Given $f : X \to Y \subset P^N$, this returns the defining ideal of $f(x) \subseteq P^N$."

        There should be some indication that f is a rational map here.  Check for similar instances elsewhere.
        Also write f(X).
        Or maybe f(X-baselocus f).
        Also, if f is a rational map, then f(X) isn't closed, so it doesn't have a defining ideal.

    "It should be noted for inputs that all rings are quotients of polynomial rings, and all ideals and ring maps are of these. "

        Poorly phrased, since "are" is not the same as "should be".  Try something
        like: "The rings provided implicitly in the inputs should be polynomial
        rings or quotients of polynomial rings."


    "subset of the the ambient projective space"

        remove a word


    "This function frequently just calls ker from Macaulay2. "

        make "ker" a link to the documentation of the function


    " it first tries to verify if the ring map is injective."

        change "if" to "whether"

        check the rest of the documentation, and whereever you see something like "check if", change it
        to "check whether"


    "inverseOfMap -- Computes the inverse map of a given birational map between projective varieties. Returns an error if the map is not birational onto its image.
    Synopsis"

        This headline is too verbose.  The purpose of headlines is to give brief hints in lists of functions.
        Try something like "inverse of a birational map".  Put the rest of the information in the body of the node.

    "Given a map f : X →Y, this finds the inverse of your birational map f(X) →X (if it is birational onto its image). "

        "this" is ambiguous, as mentioned above.
        Never use "your" -- it makes no sense.  (Similarly in the list of inputs and many other places in the documentation.)
        Try something like:

        "Given a rational map f : X → Y, this function computes the inverse of the induced map X → f(X), provided it is birational."

        Have you said somewhere that f(X) denotes the closure of the image??

        I'm not sure it's sensible, from the point of view of category theory, to replace Y by the image of f here.
        The inverse of a map f : X → Y should be a map Y → X.  Would doing so hurt applications?  If so, could you provide a way
        to produce from a map f : X → Y the corresponding map a map X → f(X)?

    "Note SimisStrategy will never terminate for non-birational maps. "

        change to "Note that SimisStrategy will never terminate for non-birational maps."


    "The option HybridLimit can weight the HybridStrategy between ReesStrategy and SimisStrategy"
    "the default value is 15 and increasing it will weight towards SimisStrategy"

        rephrase, because "weight" is a noun



    "Notice that the leading minus signs do not change the projective map."

        "change" is unclear.  How about this?:
        "Notice that removal of the leading minus signs would not change the projective map."


    "The target and source must be varieties, in particular their defining ideals must be prime."

        change comma ot semicolon


    "The next example, is a Birational map on ℙ^4."

        remove comma


    Starting inverseOfMapSimis(SimisStrategy or HybridStrategy)
    inverseOfMapSimis: About to find the image of the map.  If you know the image, you may want to use the AssumeDominant option if this is slow.
    inverseOfMapSimis: Found the image of the map.
    inverseOfMapSimis:  About to compute partial Groebner basis of rees ideal up to degree {1, 1}.
    inverseOfMapSimis: About to check rank, if this is very slow, you may try turning QuickRank=>false.
    inverseOfMapSimis:  About to compute partial Groebner basis of rees ideal up to degree {1, 2}.
    inverseOfMapSimis: About to check rank, if this is very slow, you may try turning QuickRank=>false.
    inverseOfMapSimis: We computed enough of the Groebner basis.
    inverseOfMapSimis: Found Jacobian dual matrix (or a weak form of it), it has  3 columns  and about  4 rows.
    inverseOfMapSimis: Looking for a nonzero minor. If this fails, you may increase the attempts with MinorsCount => #
    getSubmatrixOfRank: Trying to find a submatrix of rank at least: 2 with attempts = 10.  DetStrategy=>Rank
    getSubmatrixOfRank: found one, in 1 attempts
    inverseOfMapSimis: We found a nonzero minor.

        This chatter is just noise, normally, and should be off.  You could let the user turn it on
        by adding an option "Verbose", whose default value is false.  (You have true
        as the default value, so that's the problem.)



    "Only works for irreducible varieties right now. "

        Sentences need subjects.  "Only" is in the wrong place.  "Right now" refers to time, but documentation
        can be read in the future.

        Try:
        "The current implementation of this function works only for irreducible varieties. "


    "Also see the function invertBirMap in the package Cremona,"

        Make both of those links, so they can just click.

        Similarly in "Also see the very fast probabilisitc birationality checking
        of the Cremona package: isBirational"

        And perhaps elsewhere.


    "for certain types of maps from projective space is sometimes faster"

        say which types, or change to

        "for some maps from projective space is faster"



    "isBirationalMap -- Checks if a map between projective varieties is birational"

            "Checks" should not be capitalized.
            "Checks" should be omitted
            "if" should be "whether"
            
            Similarly for isBirationalOntoImage
            

    "the variables should be sent to elements of a single fixed degree"

        Maybe the real criterion is that the ring map is homogeneous.  Such maps can
        be made homogeneous with the option DegreeMap.  Maybe then you could allow
        rings where the variables don't all have degree 1.  If this really is the criterion,
        phrase it as :

        "the variables should be sent to elements of the same degree"
        
        , because "fixed" is meaningless


    "The target and source must be varieties"

        Macaulay2 actually has things called varieties, of types Variety, AffineVariety,
        and ProjectiveVariety, but none of your functions accept them.  That might be
        really elegant to orient your implementation around them.



    "Note the Frobenius map is not birational."

        change to "Note that the Frobenius map is not birational."


    "isBirationalOntoImage -- Checks if a map between projective varieties is birational onto its image."

        This function would not be needed at all if you had a way to produce from a map f : X → Y
        the corresponding map a map X → f(X).  I mentioned this above.  Why not just implement that?

        Aha, you did implement it, as mapOntoImage.  So this function is not needed.


    "Sub-Hankel matrices have homaloidal determinants."

            say what "homaloidal" and "sub-Hankel" mean somewhere


    "The source must be a variety, in particular its defining ideals must be prime."

        "in particular"?  Isn't that the whole thing?  Also used elsehwere.

        change "ideals" to "ideal"


    "isEmbedding -- Checks whether a map of projective varieties is a closed embedding."

            ... a *rational* map ...


    " Note, this function, isEmbedding, will only behave properly if CheckBirational is set to true."

        In that case, the function should not accept the option from the user.  Why let the
        user break your code?  Change it.


    "jacobianDualMatrix -- Computes the Jacobian Dual Matrix, a matrix whose kernel describing the syzygies of the inverse map."

                too verbose
                don't capitalize Dual Matrix
                "describing" should be "describes" (but move that to the body of the documentation)
                inverse rational maps don't have syzygies -- matrices have syzygies


    "This is mostly an internal function which is used when checking"

        add comma before "which"
        Check for other uses of "which" that will need commas, too.


    "this just returns S/kernel →R."

        kernel of what?


    "correspoing"

        fix


    "mapOntoImage -- Given a map of rings, correspoing to X mapping to Y, this returns the map of rings corresponding to X mapping to f(X)."

            X and Y are undefined.  Better say:

            "mapOntoImage -- the induced map from a variety to its image under a rational map"

    "invovling"

        fix

        maybe run the documentation through a spell checker!


    "the functions will try to make an educated guess as to how big to make this, depending on varieties you are working with."

        wordy.  Also "try" is wrong, because they will always succeed in guessing (presumably).
            
            Try

        "these functions will determine a value using a heuristic that depends on the varieties involved"


    "MinorsCount -- An option controlling the behavior of isBirational and inverseOfMap (and other functions which call those)."

            headlines should address the meat.  Try

            "MinorsCount -- an option to limit the number of random minors computed"

            Why not rename it to MinorsLimit?


    " computed via the packageFastLinAlg"

        add a space
        add a period


    "It is a valid value for the Strategy Option for inverseOfMap "

        pronouns, such as "it", always need antecedents.  Don't use them otherwise.


    "the equation of the ideal of definition of the Rees algebra are generated"

                change "are" to "is" or change "equation" to "equations"


    "E.g. Vasconcelos, Rees algebras, multiplicities, algorithms. Springer Monographs in Mathematics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2005."

        What are all those periods doing?  Make complete sentences.  Also you omitted the title of the book: "Integral closure".

        Start like this: "This technique is described in the book "Integral closure" by Wolmer Vasconcelos ... "

        Also give a precise page number for the algorithm.

    "SaturateOutput -- If false, certain functions will not saturate their output."

            headline to wordy.  Try

            "SaturateOutput -- whether the value returned should be saturated"


    "SaturationStrategy -- A strategy for inverseOfMap, isBirationalMap, isEmbedding."

                don't mention the functions in the headline.  Instead say something
                about the option itself, such as "the strategy for computing saturations"

                Check all other headlines for names of functions and exterminate


    "It is a valid value for the Strategy Option for inverseOfMap "

        pronouns, as above, need antecedents

        check all other nodes for descriptions starting with pronouns


    "algerba"

        fix


    " only this part of the Rees ideal is enough to decide Birationality "

        "only"?  What could it mean here?  Eliminate it.

        "part of the Rees ideal" -- what could that mean?  The previous
        sentence was about Groebner bases.

        don't capitalize Birationality


    "all Grobner basis"

                the o in every Grobner needs an umlaut.  Documentation accepts Unicode.

            "bases" instead of "basis" here


    "looking for all Grobner basis with first degree 1."

        what does "with first degree 1" mean?


    "... ; so that this Strategy reduces the number of computations. "

        "so"?

        "number of computations" -- not relevant, if they're faster in toto

        Rephrase, perhaps as

        "... ; this strategy reduces computation time. "



    "disadvatage"

        fix


    I got tired at SimisStrategy

    comments on the code:

    Version => "0.3"

        if the package is good enough to be published, it's good enough
        to be called version 1


    "isSameMap -- Checks whether two maps to projective space are really the same"

        The existence of this unnatural function suggests a rewrite of the code.
        Introduce a new type called "RationalMap".  Maybe make source and target
        be varieties instead of rings.  Then for two rational maps f and g,
        you could check equality in a method installed for evaluating "f == g".

        The use of this type throughout the code would add a lot of clarity, for
        all those functions that take either ideals or rings with lists or ring
        maps would now *just* take objects of type RationalMap.  Internally, your
        implementation would store that data inside the object.
